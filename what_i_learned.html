    <h1>What have I learned</h1>

    <p>I’ve learned quite a lot from this project. I will admit that it was challenging but it was also very rewarding. To start off, I improved on my HTML skills quite a bit. I was familiar with it but had not much experience writing it myself. <br />
      It wasn’t very difficult to get into it either, it felt somewhat intuitive. The real challenge was learning javascript and utilising d3. As with HTML, I mostly learned javascript using Codeacademy online. <br />
      I also learned how to set up a local server as well as a working web server through github.
