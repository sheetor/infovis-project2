  <p> When starting out with WVS we are greeted by this screen indicating which interval of years we wish to explore. </p>


    <img src= "Skrmklipp2.PNG">
    <p> I choose the latest option of 2010-2014 to see how the most recent results look. </p>

    <p> Following is the selection of which countries one wishes to investigate. I purposely select Sweden and Chile due to personal connection. I also randomly select a few countries from the different continents.
      <br /b> What greets you afterwards is a swath of different surveys and survey questions that are available. The amount ranges from more than 250 different questions with results varying from quantitative and qualitative. </p>

    <img src= "Skrmklipp3.PNG">

    <p>What comes next is the result itself. In this particular case I find the topmost survey question particularly interesting. And so I select the topmost survey question. </p>

    <p>What is shown here is the result of the selected survey question throughout every country previously selected. In the bottom it shows what year each country provided their results. Overall the majority do not seem to mind having neighbors with AIDS however some of the countries have over 75% who donâ€™t want neighbors with AIDS.</p>

    <p>Going back and selecting the entire data set we can get a greater overview using the map-view.</p>
